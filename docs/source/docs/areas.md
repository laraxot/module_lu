# Areas {#areas}

Areas are the modules enabled for every user.

This means that every user can only see its enabled modules in admin area.

Example:

![Enabled Areas](/assets/images/enabled_areas.png)

In this example i can see only Blog, Chart and Notify modules inside /admin

## What to do if areas aren't visible

If i can't see some areas, i can click in LU->area

And then click the *sync area button* (icon with *refresh* symbol)
